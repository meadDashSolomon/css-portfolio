This is a CSS based portfolio

## Further Improvements

- Add a CSS-only hamburger button, a CSS-only dropdown, or both to the navbar.
- Add a contact form to the site rather than an email button.
- Expand the projects section. Rather than presenting all project information on the home page, present an overview and a link to more extensive details and links as an additional page.
