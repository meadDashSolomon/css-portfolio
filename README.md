## Description

This portfolio website features stylized text, CSS gradients, navigation bars, and semantic HTML. Responsive styling makes this site look great on both desktops and mobile devices. The homepage displays my recent projects and the about page provides information about who I am.

## Further Improvements

- Add a CSS-only hamburger button, a CSS-only dropdown, or both to the navbar.
- Add a contact form to the site rather than an email button.
- Expand the projects section. Rather than presenting all project information on the home page, present an overview and a link to more extensive details and links as an additional page.
